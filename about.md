I am Pratik Mishra, a Junior undergraduate at the [Department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing](http://www.iitk.ac.in/math/) at [IIT Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in/).

I am passionate about Mathematics,Computer Science and Machine Learning. I am fairly active at competitive programming. 

I like to [write](https://pratik1105.github.io/blog/) (occasionally).I enjoy(both playing and watching) all kinds of sports including but not limited to Basketball, Football(Soccer), Cricket, Table-Tennis, Badminton and Tennis.

I am also an avid reader of detective fiction([goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16333763-pratik-mishra)). One of my produest achievements is that I have read **each and every** Sherlock Holmes story that Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote(and published).
Recently I have also started reading non-fiction.

I watch tons of TV shows (mainly from USA and UK).Chances are, I do watch your favorite TV show. So that could be an ice-breaker should we ever talk.
