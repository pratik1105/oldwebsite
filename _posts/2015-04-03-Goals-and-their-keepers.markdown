I have a goal and I want to see it through
But self-doubt showed up and with time it grew.

What about the people who are stronger,smarter,"better" than me?
They'll always out perform me. It's a fact,you can't disagree.

So why bother? why not just throw in the towel and accept defeat
Let the others do it and I'll admire/critique, as usual, from the back-seat.

But Wait. How come other people decide what i can achieve or not
probably because goals are relative just like we are taught.

So if i set absolute goals and be satisfied with them
then my self-doubt would have absolutely nothing to condemn.

Now my mind is clear,focussed and there is something i clearly see
the only walls which block my success have been built by me.
