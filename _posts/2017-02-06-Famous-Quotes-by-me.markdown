This is one of the many stupid ideas that come into my head and one of the few that I actually act upon.  

Without further ado, let me intoduce you to the only resource on the internet that contains actual quotes that I came up with.   

The quotes could be both in hindi and english.  

In case of hindi quotes, I try to provide english translations for the same.

Right now it has a sole entry. Let's hope this list expands in the future.

<h3>Quote number 1</h3>  

> "Sabse zada effort lagta hai effort lgaane me"  

Translation : The hardest part of any task is to put in the hardwork.
