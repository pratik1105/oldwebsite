one is 'sophisticated' while the other one is from Bihar.

A heterosexual and a homosexual musician walk into a bar
one is an 'artist' while the other one is just bizarre.

Two Car enthusiasts walk into a bar
One owns a Jaguar while the other owns Jaguar.

Two equally dumb, vulgar, misogynistic, unsuccessful guys walk into a bar
one gets the deserved treatment from the opposite sex, but the other guy plays a guitar.

A future assassin walks into a bar
his weapons of choice:a cigarette, a beedi, a cigar.

An Actor, having attended his mother's funeral, walks into a bar
over a drink he wonders,now who's the bigger star.
