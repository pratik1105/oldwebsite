This isn't the first time I find myself _lost_.  

_Lost_ not in space, for I know where I am.  
After all its the Same room every evening,  
Maybe I am just a buggy simulation, or a dull hologram.   
*I wish*  

I think I am not alone either  
for there are human shapes moving around, looking '_alive_'.  
If I can trust my own faculties, my own eyes,  
I can count about 3...no 4....shit there's 5.  

But when did these shapes materialize in the first place ?  
I have no idea and frankly, who cares ?  
I just wish they go back to their lairs.  
Soon.  

Their mouths seem to be moving,  
so I am assuming they are letting some words through  
I feel like I must declare here that,  
I am, of course, hearing voices too.  

Please do not be confused  
and wrongly assume that its their words in my head.  
Because the conversations that I am having,  
Well......they are better left unsaid.
