Why do questions on tests worry us
but more fundamental ones do not ?

Have you ever pondered on them
or you just can't spare a thought ?

Why is it that 2 hours on a screen
is better motivation than our dearest dream ?

Why is it that we aspire to be creative artists
and yet risks are nowhere on our lists ?

Why does the determination in our overnight thoughts
vanish the following morning ?

Why does habitual procrastination not
blare as a deadly warning ?

Why is pessimism the common denominator
in the fractions that make up life ?

Why can't Happiness be the butter
and Hope be the knife.
