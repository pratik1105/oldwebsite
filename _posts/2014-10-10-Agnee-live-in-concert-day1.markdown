Time : who cares.
After all, its a concert.

This is my second concert in about 2 weeks and there is something i already know. You just can not live a concert vicariously. Yet, i try to describe it the best i can.

We enter the auditorium grounds where the stage is set for Agnee to set it ablaze. As is custom, they are late. Well, they are rock stars. Its pretty much in their work profile. Anyways we are greeted with giant screens presenting Coke studio Music. The crowd, huge, excited waited anxiously for the show to begin.

Finally, i hear a familiar voice. Wait, is it really him ? YES. Its Hoze from MTV who is going to introduce Agnee on stage. He shares a few laughs with the crowds, instagram's a few pics and finally announces Agnee.

And then its on. Agnee on stage, crowd going nuts and well us trying to wrestle our way to the front. We do manage to do so and finally earn the best seats in the house. What followed was an out pour of some soulful music that permeated the entire crowd. We got to sing along with Kannan Mohan, the vocalist and that was really fun. The atmosphere in the crowd was just how i pictured a concert in my head. With pretty much zero space to move around in the thick crowd, Agnee made our Hearts go up and down all night. Yaariyaan and Aahatein turned out to be crowd favorites as every voice sang in chorus. With round after round of amazing compositions, Agnee won a lot of hearts tonight. I hesitate to say more about the concert because i believe it wont be able to capture its essence.

We left as Agnee thanked us for being a terrific crowd and bid us farewell. Pictures generally follow a rock concert and we didn't disappoint the tradition. Looking back, i think it was a night to remember.
