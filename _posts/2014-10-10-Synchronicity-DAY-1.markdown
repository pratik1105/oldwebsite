Well, first things first. Unfortunately, i missed major portions of the preparations for Antaragni in the morning thanks to sleep. Also, i would like to take this opportunity to state that this series of blog posts would not be an extensive coverage of Antaragni 2014 simply because there's only so many events i can attend. That being said, lets move on.

So, at long last, Antaragni 2014 finally kicks off. Or does it ?

Its quarter past 6 and we enter the Open Air Theater(OAT), full of exuberance,  midst a thin and weary crowd waiting eagerly for the bands to weave their magic. To those of you who do not know, Synchronicity is a major rock band contest at Antaragni. Things here at IITK never start on time but then do cool things ever ?

While we look for front row seats, the bands begin warming up. This is as big a stage as up and coming bands are going to get to showcase their talent and get into the big leagues. Failing here is not an option. So, the first band comes out, get the beats going. Its really weird and yet beautiful to see people who have worked their asses off to get into IIT nodding their heads to rock. Right in front of us, those cliched rock stars with more hair on their chin than their head, with chains dangling everywhere pace around in their baggy's eager to impress. I stay there for a couple of performances and unfortunately that's  pretty much my threshold at the moment for rock. Not a big fan, i am sorry. So right as a big burly guy with tattoo's all over his arm takes the stage with his Fender, i leave with my heart still thumping with the drums in the background.

My room-mate Rohit who is a volunteer at Synchronicity, tells me that the show only got better with amazing performances in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Turns out i missed something. Ah well, its just the prelims. We'll be back for the main thing.
